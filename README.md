# Tailwind CSS Gradient Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS gradients fail to render properly in certain situations due to browser inconsistencies or CSS conflicts.

## Bug Description

The issue arises when using Tailwind's gradient utility classes (e.g., `bg-gradient-to-r`, `from-blue-500`, `to-purple-500`). In some browsers or when conflicting CSS styles are present, the gradient might not render, appear incorrectly, or may be completely absent.

## Solution

The solution explores a few options to address this issue. This includes using fallbacks, ensuring proper CSS specificity, and potentially opting for a different gradient approach.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
